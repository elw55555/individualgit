## Study Plan:

Monday: Devise study plan and do general review for Tuesday's MCQ. The purpose of the MC is to gauge where my weaknesses are at.

Tuesday: Take MCQ at school and analyze performance. Update: Most missed unit skills:
- 5a - describe the behavior and conditions that produce identified results in a program
- 2c - describe the output, value, or result of given program code given initial values
- 1b - determine required code segments to produce a given output

At home, use [Georgia Tech's practice exams](https://www.apcsaexam.org/mcpractice.html) and to more questions corresponding to these skills.

Wednesday: Take Tuesday MCQ and do further review with personal test corrections. Then get familiar with FRQ format for Thuesday exam.
Do this FRQ at home to prepare for the writing format: [1999 Official Exam](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/compsci_a_99.pdf) Then quickly view answers and see mistakes, but do not focus too much. Focus more on familiarizing with the format and do a complete review after the class FRQ on thursday.

Thursday: Take FRQ at school and take home to analyze performance. Update: most missed unit skills from BOTH tests:
- here
- here
- here

Review mistakes using the [provided scoring guideliens](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/apc/1999_cs_q_a.pdf)

Friday: Continue with FRQ review if not finished or not understood. Go home and find which units to study. Devise a study plan to study what I don't know. Use AP exam live reviews on youtube provided by [CB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NXby4ahlnU&list=PLoGgviqq4845xKOY11PnkE7aqJC7-bYrd) as well as [Ajay Gandecha's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYLJbVECJxs&list=PLfpeXtDSa8rUl8S9NtbPKlg0ikc-rw-LC) that goes through each unit very well. Determine video study plan.
